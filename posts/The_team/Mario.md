# Mario Schweikert
Hey! My name is Mario and I am 16 years old. I am in year 11 at a German academic high
school. When I was 6 years old, I got my first computer. 6 years later I started
programming and took part in some competitions. Currently my favorite programminglanguage
is Python but I also program in Java. After accomplishing my A-levels, I want to
study computer science. The competition „Bundeswettbewerb Künstliche Intelligenz“
aroused my interest in AI.

For a change I also do sports, e.g. tennis or cycling. In addition, I dance Standard/Latin at
a dancing school.
