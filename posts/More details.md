# More project details

In our project, we created a smartphone-app which detects when someone falls. The app must be installed and activated, then once it's up and running it continues to monitor. If the app/AI detects a possible fall by unusual acceleration or rotation of the mobile, it opens itself on the surface screen. In case of an inaccurate detection of a fall, a "false alarm" so to speak, the person carrying the mobile can decline the accuracy of fall on the touchscreen. 
In case that a person has fallen but needs no help the person can also click on the screen function: “Deactivate progress” to inactivate the time counter which will at the end of the count down automatically send an emergency call. In case of a false fall detection where the counter is stopped by the user a additional feedback is given to the AI program. In this way the AI keeps learning and becomes more precise. 
If the system receives no "answer" by the mobile carrier, it is very likely that a fall has occurred and the person is in need of help due to injury and/or unconsciousness. In this case, after a certain time frame (30 seconds) the app sends an emergency call, by itself, to an emergency hotline with the actual coordinates and data of the phone.
