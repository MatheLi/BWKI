# More project details

In the past weeeks we analysed and checked the data for our model. Then we created a model reached an accuracy of 95% with training data and 98% on test data. While creating we had problems with data Preprocessing. Now we are programming an android-app in Java, which is reading the sensor data and is directly linked with the server and our model.
