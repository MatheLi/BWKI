# More project details
In our project, we created a smartphone-app which detects falls of human bodies. The app must be installed and activated once and is running since then. If the app/AI detects a possible fall by unusual accerleration or rotation of the mobile, it opens itself on the surface screen. In case of an inappropriate detection of a putative fall the carrier of the mobile can decline the accuracy of fall detection on the touchscreen. 
In case that a person has fallen but needs no help the person can also click on the screen function: “Deactivate progress” to inactivate the time counter which will at the end of the count down automatically sending an emergency call. In case of a false fall detection, where the counter is stopped by the user a additional feedback is given to the AI program. In this way the AI keeps learning itself and becomes more precise. 
If the system receives no "answer" by the mobile carrier, it is very likely that a fall has occured and the person needs help due to injury and/or unconsciousness. In this case after a certain time frame (30 seconds) the app is sending an emergency call itself to an emergency hotline with the actual coordinates and data of the phone.
