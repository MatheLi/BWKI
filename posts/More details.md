# More project details
That’s why we decided to create a smartphone-app which detects falls. The app must be installed and activated once and is running since then. If it detects a fall (unusual rotation of the phone or speed) it opens the app itself and is asking if the fall was detected right. When no answer after 30 seconds follows the app is sending an emergency call with the actual position of the phone. If the person is fallen but still can move or hasn’t any bigger injury the person can click on the button “Deactivate progress”, where she deactivates the time counter before the program is sending the emergency call. In case of a false fall detection of the program there is another button “False detection” which if it is pressed is not only stopping the time counter but also is giving feedback to the program. In this way the AI is still learning and learning.
